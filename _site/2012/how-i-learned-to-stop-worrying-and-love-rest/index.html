<p>Buzzwords can be a funny thing. I&#8217;ve been writing (what I thought were) &#8216;RESTful&#8217; web apps and APIs for five years now, and it wasn&#8217;t until a couple of weeks ago that I really began to understand what that meant. I&#8217;d like to share my &#8216;<span class="caps">AHA</span>&#8217; moment, and give a concrete example of why following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> style correctly can save you headaches in the long run.</p>
<div id="tldr">
<p><em>TL;DR: A RESTful <span class="caps">API</span> should provide hypertext links to drive traversal through itself, instead of forcing the client to craft their own URIs.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Many have complained about the font on my site, but I personally like it. If you&#8217;re having trouble with it though, just click <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="font-changer">here</a>.</p>
<h3>A little backstory</h3>
<p>At <a href="http://www.twinenginelabs.com">Twin Engine Labs</a>, we develop iOS apps that are generally backed by Rails <span class="caps">REST</span> APIs. We&#8217;ve been doing this for a little over a year now, and are constantly refining our process. A few weeks ago I built my first iOS app (which got approved this week) as well as the <span class="caps">JSON</span> <span class="caps">API</span> backend for it. I take a lot of pride in my code, and I have to say I was quite pleased with how everything turned out. The project felt clean, things were refactored as I felt they needed to be, and nothing was overly complex or ugly.  However, at the end of the project lifecycle, I started looking to increase performance by adding basic Rails caching where it was appropriate, and things took an unhappy turn.</p>
<p>At this point, the iOS app was complete and had been submitted to the app store. If you&#8217;ve ever gone through this process, you know the delays can be&#8230;annoying, and resubmitting is essentially out of the question if you have a deadline to worry about. None of this should have been a problem, since the <span class="caps">API</span> was frozen and I was just making internal performance changes, but then I started looking at caching one of the main actions of the application.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fairly simple index action that returns a list of <span class="caps">JSON</span> objects, but the rub comes in that it&#8217;s paginated. This action is consumed by a TableView that has infinite scrolling on it, so we only load 25 at a time to make things snappier on the iPhone. We handle all of our pagination using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate</a> gem, where page information is passed as query params like: <code>www.myapi.com/index_action?page=1&amp;per_page=25</code>. Unfortunately default Rails page caching doesn&#8217;t store query params, so you&#8217;ll always cache the first page a user hits. The <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#page-caching">suggested means of dealing with this</a> is to, instead of using query params, pass your pagination params through the <span class="caps">URI</span>, transforming the above example to this: <code>www.myapi.com/index_action/page/1/per_page/25</code>.</p>
<p>This would be trivial to implement on the Rails side, but since my iOS application was crafting these paginated URIs it would mean a change to the iOS code and a resubmission to the app store.  The action was fast enough that I moved caching it to a lower priority, but it ate at me that I hadn&#8217;t known about the pitfall earlier.</p>
<h3>The <span class="caps">AHA</span> moment</h3>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until several weeks later that I came upon the perfect solution to my problem&#8230;at least it would have been had I used it from the beginning as I should have.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got about a 30 minute bike commute every morning, and I find the best use of that time is to listen to tech podcasts. More specifically I&#8217;ve been listening to the <a href="http://www.rubyrogues.com">Ruby Rogues</a> podcast for the past few weeks; catching up on the backlog as well as keeping up with the latest episodes as they come out. Recently I listened to the <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/rest-done-right-with-steve-klabnik/"><span class="caps">REST</span> Done Right</a> episode where they had Steve Klabnik on as a guest panelist. If you follow Steve on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/steveklabnik">twitter</a> or read his <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/">blog</a>, you&#8217;ll know he&#8217;s a big proponent of <span class="caps">REST</span> and does a lot to educate developers on its proper usage.</p>
<p>In that podcast they mentioned that one of the core points of <span class="caps">REST</span> is that the resources should provide the means to traverse the <span class="caps">API</span>. Think of it like links on a webpage; we don&#8217;t expect the user to know our <span class="caps">URL</span> format and manually type it in when they want to view the next link. Instead we provide them hyperlinks so they can easily traverse our sites. A <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> should function the same way; when you provide someone a list of <span class="caps">JSON</span> objects, you should also provide the <span class="caps">URI</span> to access each of those objects, or, in the case of my pagination example, the <span class="caps">URI</span> to retrieve the next page of results. To quote Roy Fielding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial <span class="caps">URI</span> (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the <span class="caps">API</span>). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the userâ€™s manipulation of those representations. <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steve Klabnik also talks about this very issue in his wonderful article titled <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/haters-gonna-hateoas">Haters gonna <span class="caps">HATEOAS</span></a>.  (<span class="caps">HATEOAS</span> stands for &#8216;Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State&#8217; and refers to using hypertext to direct an <span class="caps">API</span> consumer through the application).  You should definitely read his article to get a great explanation of how it should work and how/why most people aren&#8217;t currently doing it.</p>
<p>So while listening to this podcast, somewhere on the bike path between the office and home, it hit me: Instead of crafting the paginated <span class="caps">URI</span> in my iOS client, I should have been crafting that <span class="caps">URI</span> on the Rails side and sending it through along with my list of <span class="caps">JSON</span> objects. I&#8217;d actually dealt with this exact format on the iOS side when I was consuming the Facebook search <span class="caps">API</span>. Here is an example of how the Facebook Graph <span class="caps">API</span> handles pagination:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="c1">#http://graph.facebook.com/search?type=Page&amp;q=dcuocentral</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;data&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;DCUO Central&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Website&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;141968085865824&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;paging&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;next&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://graph.facebook.com/search?type=Page&amp;q=dcuocentral&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=25&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>All you have to do is pluck the <code>paging</code> key out of the <span class="caps">JSON</span> and hit that <span class="caps">URI</span> for your next page (though they annoyingly provide that <span class="caps">URI</span> even if there are no more records to be returned).</p>
<p>By following the <span class="caps">REST</span> style, I would have saved myself either <em>A)</em> having to alter my iOS code and resubmit to the store, or <em>B)</em> time spent researching alternate caching methods and implementing them in Rails. As it stands, my partially-RESTful <span class="caps">API</span> is going to cost me (and possibly the client) more time before we can call the project finished.</p>
<p>All of that said, I think that Rails does an amazing job of making it easy to implement <span class="caps">REST</span>. I&#8217;ve been doing a large part of it without even really understanding it. I&#8217;m not sure how well it works when you want to go all the way, but that&#8217;s something I intend to explore as I learn more about <span class="caps">REST</span> and build APIs in the months to come. I&#8217;m also eagerly awaiting Steve Klabnik&#8217;s book <a href="http://getsomere.st/">Get Some Rest</a>, which looks to be a great resource on developing RESTful applications in Rails as well as explaining the details of <span class="caps">REST</span> in a more approachable way.</p>
